Amazon URL shortener
====================

Amazon used to offer short links in their ``share`` link on item pages.  But
they stopped.

So here's a Chrome extension which does this for you.  I'd publish it, but
having experience with publishing Android aps, I'm tired of how Google keep
changing the rules every time you want to make a bugfix.  So I probably won't
bother.
